This script resizes multiple JPG files from a gallery folder (which has to be called "imagedir" on the Desktop) while maintaining the original orientation of the image (portrait or landscape). This script automatically performs a centered crop to fit a 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio, then resizes images to a resolution of 1920×1080 (horizontal) or 1080×1920 (vertical) depending on the orientation initial of the image.
