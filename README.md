# HTML Table Generator
HTML Table Generator with adjustable rows and columns for creating clear tabular structures that chatbots can properly interpret. This web tool solves the problem of sharing tabular data with AI models, since copying tables as plain text loses the row/column relationships. With a simple interface, you can visually design tables and get clean HTML code that preserves data structure, allowing chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini to perfectly understand the information and perform accurate conversions or analysis. Perfect for developers, analysts, and anyone needing to efficiently pass tabular data to AI systems.
